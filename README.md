I will be developing a complete website for a real state agency for the next months (as a remote part-time job where I can manage my times enterely)
And  software that helps the employees to manage the properties, dates, costs controls, keys, customer tracking and more.

With React.js and Java Spring Boot. Later I will be uploading wich tools, librarys, frameworks and everything I use and a proper explanation about them such as where and how do I use X or Y tool.

The firsts 2-3 weeks I spent most of my time working with the owners of the agency and their employees to know what they WANT, what they HAVE and what they NEED.

1) Make a proper research before doing any prototype: (General knowledge of the company. Firsts things to consider when making the frontend)
    1.1) knowing the main target audience
    1.2) Using the colours they been using the last 20 years and the logo they have
2) organize what information they have and determine what needs to be used: (General knowledge of the company administration, HOW and with WHAT information they work. First things to consider when making the manager)
    2.1) Starting with a canvas blackboard with most of the information collected

    2.2) Next I had to make a proper UML (with app.diagrams.net) before start making the BD in MySQL.
3) Start doing prototypes on figma to show, discuse and choose what would be the bests options taking in consideration a proper ux/ui design, the company requeriments, the target audience and personal tips.
